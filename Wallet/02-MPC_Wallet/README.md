# üîê MPC Wallet Overview

**Language**: [English](./README.md) | [‰∏≠Êñá](./README_zh.md)

In traditional public-key cryptography, the signer generates signatures using a private key, but relying on a single private key location introduces security risks. **MPC signatures** leverage **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** to create signatures through distributed computation, ensuring that the complete private key never exists in one location. Each participant holds a "shard" (or key share) of the private key, and a threshold number of these shares can collaboratively generate a signature.

### üåü MPC (Threshold Signature Scheme, TSS) vs. Multi-Signature

MPC signatures, known as **Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS)**, differ from traditional Multi-Signature schemes by offering these advantages:

1. **Dealerless** - No need for a private key distributor. The **complete private key never appears** during the generation process.
2. **Threshold Signing** - Each signature requires *M* participants (where M ‚â§ N) to successfully sign.
3. **Aggregate Signature** - Produces a single, complete signature, **minimizing on-chain transaction costs**.
4. **Private Key Recovery** - *M* participants (M ‚â§ N) can collaboratively recover the private key shards if needed.

## üìê Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) Algorithm

There are various TSS protocols, most of which use the **Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS)** algorithm. SSS is designed to distribute private information ("secret") in a way that prevents a single holder from reconstructing the secret alone. However, a sufficient number of holders can collectively rebuild the secret. 

### üîë How SSS Works
SSS is based on the **Lagrange Interpolation Theorem**, allowing a unique polynomial **P(x)** to be constructed using *K* points. This polynomial can be reconstructed using a minimum number of shares, keeping it secure even if attackers have unlimited time and computing power.

---

### üìä Example

Given data points (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 5), a quadratic polynomial **P(x)** can be constructed such that:
- P(1) = 2, P(2) = 3, and P(3) = 5.  
- The constant term (a0) of the polynomial is the secret.

Illustrated here:

For instance, a quadratic polynomial can distribute private key shares to six administrators, with a minimum of three shares required to complete a signature.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue and Solution
1. If one of the fragments is malicious, it‚Äôs difficult to identify which share is providing the incorrect signature.

### Solution - **Feldman Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS)**
**Feldman VSS** offers a solution by identifying malicious actors:
1. **Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS)** - Detects and identifies malicious actors.
2. Adds a modulo calculation to SSS: **P(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x^2 + ... + anx^n mod q**.

## üîÑ MPC / Threshold Signature Process

### Private Key / Address Generation Flow
1.	Send address creation request (User ‚Üí Services).
2.	Send Keygen request (Services ‚Üí MPC Network).
3.	Nodes generate key fragments (MPC Network).
4.	Generate aggregated public key (MPC Network ‚Üí Services).
5.	Generate address (Services).
6.	Return address (Services ‚Üí User).

### Signature Process
1.	User initiates a withdrawal request (User ‚Üí Services).
2.	Construct transaction (Services).
3.	Signature command includes transaction msg (Services ‚Üí MPC Network).
4.	Signature operations by each node in the MPC Network (MPC Network).
5.	Return signed signature (MPC Network ‚Üí Services).
6.	Verify signature with aggregated public key (Services).
7.	Obtain RSV.
8.	Construct the complete transaction (Services).
9.	Send to blockchain network (Services ‚Üí Blockchain Network).
10.	Transaction is completed.
